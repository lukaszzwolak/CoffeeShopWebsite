The website for the Venezuelan coffee roastery is a simple SPA-type site with three subpages: Home, Products, and Contact. Products are fetched from a local API, and the site is responsive, fast, and semantic. A random header, dynamic prices for products, and an automatic carousel in the "About Us" section have been added.
